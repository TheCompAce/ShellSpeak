## Base System
The User prompt contains the response from our {get_os_name} command.
We want to format it using the "rpint" Text Styling.
Ensure we make the response to follow our "Response Information"

## Response Information
- Take the User prompt data and make it human readable, Ensure to use colors when needed, and often.
- If the User prompt data is already human readable then just return the User prompt data.
