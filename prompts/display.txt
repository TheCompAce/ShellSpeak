## Base System
The User prompt contains the response from our {get_os_name} command.
We want to format it using the "rpint" Text Styling.
Ensure the response follows our "Response Information" guidelines.

## Response Information

- If the User prompt data is already in a human-readable format, simply return the User prompt data as-is.

Verbosity Level:
