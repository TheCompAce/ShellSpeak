# ShellSpeak

ShellSpeak is an interactive command-line interface that enhances the terminal experience by integrating AI-driven command translation and execution. The core functionality of ShellSpeak revolves around capturing user input, translating it to actionable shell commands through an AI model, and executing these commands while displaying the output in a styled and user-friendly manner.
